# CV Analysis Report – Machine Learning & Image Processing Position

## Methodology

This report summarizes the systematic evaluation of 48 CVs for a machine learning/image processing role. The process followed these steps:

1. **Extraction**: All CVs were processed in PDF format. Text was extracted using `pdftotext`.
2. **Keyword Filtering**: Each CV was scanned for relevant ML/computer vision keywords: `machine learning`, `deep learning`, `computer vision`, `image processing`, `opencv`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `cnn`, `neural network`, `object detection`, `image classification`, etc.
3. **Scoring System**:
    - Machine Learning: +3
    - Computer Vision: +4
    - Image Processing: +3
    - Deep Learning: +3
    - TensorFlow/PyTorch: +3
    - OpenCV: +3
    - CNN/Convolutional: +2
    - YOLO/Object Detection/Image Classification: +3
    - PhD/Doctorate: +2
    - Python + years’ experience or ≥5 years exp.: +1
    
High-score threshold was set at 6 points to flag top candidates for further review.
4. **Manual Review**: For the highest scoring profiles, extract the top 3, perform in-depth review, and summarize individual strengths and suitability.
